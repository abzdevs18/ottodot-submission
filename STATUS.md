- ✅ Asynchronous problem generation via BullMQ
- ✅ AI-powered problem creation (Google Gemini Pro)
- ✅ Student answer submission with async feedback
- ✅ Real-time updates via Socket.IO
- ✅ Teacher dashboard with live student activity

### Phase 2: Nice-to-Have Features ✅
- ✅ Adaptive difficulty (tracks last 5 problems, auto-adjusts)
- ✅ Full gamification system (5 badge types, progress tracking)
- ✅ BullMQ admin panel with queue monitoring
- ✅ Real-time activity broadcasting to teachers

### All Three User Dashboards ✅
