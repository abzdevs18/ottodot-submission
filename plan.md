🛠️ Detailed Implementation Plan
Phase 1 – Core Features (Required by Assessment)

✅ Setup with Next.js, Tailwind, Supabase, Redis, BullMQ, Socket.IO

Student generates a problem → Job pushed to BullMQ → AI service generates problem/answer → saved in Supabase.

Student submits answer → stored in DB → feedback generated asynchronously → pushed back via Socket.IO.

Teacher dashboard shows student activity in real time.

Phase 2 – Nice-to-Have Features (Stand Out)
1. Adaptive Difficulty

Logic: Track student’s accuracy (last 5 problems).

If >80% correct → request AI for harder problem.

If <50% correct → request AI for easier problem.

Stored in DB: difficulty_level per session.

2. Gamification

Maintain badges and progress table in Supabase.

Award badges like:

“Streak Master” (5 correct in a row).

“Persistence” (10 attempts in one session).

Show progress bar and badges board on Student UI.

3. BullMQ Admin Panel

Integrate bull-board
 with a protected Admin route (/admin/queue).

Admin sees pending, failed, completed jobs.

Retry/cancel jobs manually from panel.

🎯 Features by User Role
👩‍🎓 Students

Generate math problems (AI-driven).

Submit answers and get instant feedback.

See performance history (correct %, attempt logs).

Earn badges + progress visualization (gamification).

Adaptive problem difficulty adjusts based on skill.

👩‍🏫 Teachers

Live dashboard of students currently solving problems.

Real-time student submissions (socket-powered).

Analytics: accuracy %, most common mistakes, average solving time.

Option to override AI feedback with teacher notes (future enhancement).

👨‍💼 Admins

Queue monitoring (BullMQ jobs: pending, failed, retries).

System health dashboard (DB, Redis, API stats).

User/teacher management (basic CRUD).

Audit logs (record of sessions + submissions).

✅ With this plan + diagrams, you’re showing:

Technical depth (Redis, BullMQ, Socket.IO, Supabase).

Scalability thinking (job queue, admin monitoring).

Educational impact (adaptive difficulty, analytics, gamification).

This makes your solution more than just the assignment — it’s a mini LMS prototype.
